# Twichtimeshift2

**Twichtimeshift2** is a powerful Electron desktop app that lets you watch Twitch VODs as if you were watching them live — adjusted to your local time and offset preferences. Built over many iterations with core contributions from Killian Miles and development assistance from ChatGPT.

## What It Does

Twichtimeshift2:
- Syncs Twitch VODs to your **local time** as if the stream started at the same hour in your timezone
- Lets you **choose your timezone** (Berlin, New York, Tokyo, etc.)
- Lets you apply a **time offset** (like +24 hours) so streams play exactly when you want them
- Automatically calculates how far into the VOD you are based on current time
- Opens the stream in a **locked Twitch player** (no scrubbing, no rewinding)
- Splits streamers into **Online** vs **Offline** with accurate start/end time info
- Lets you **add and remove streamers** via a simple popup menu
- Includes a **custom icon** (time-traveling capybara)
- Fully GUI-powered — no command line needed

##  Why It Was Created

Like many Twitch fans, I was frustrated living in a different timezone from my favorite streamers. Streams often started while I was sleeping or busy, and catching up later never felt right — the experience was disconnected and full of spoilers.

So I built Twichtimeshift2 to bring the live stream feel back — by syncing VODs to your local time as if they just started.

### Example Use Case:
A streamer goes live at **6 PM in Los Angeles**, but you live in **Berlin**. You use Twichtimeshift2 to simulate that stream starting at **6 PM Berlin time** the next day. If you open the app at **7:30 PM**, the VOD starts playing **90 minutes in**, just like a live experience synced to your day.

##  How It Works

1. The app checks your selected streamers using the Twitch API
2. It pulls their most recent VOD and finds the original **stream start time**
3. Converts that time into your **selected timezone**
4. Applies your chosen **hour offset** (e.g., +24 hours) to simulate delayed playback
5. If the current time is **within the simulated stream window**, it shows as ONLINE
6. Click “Watch” to open the embedded Twitch player at the correct timestamp
